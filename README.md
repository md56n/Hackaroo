We designed an Android app to be an account management system. Our app keeps track of different users and their accounts and transactions.
We have 12 functions in our app:  

InvalidUsername - text shows only if user enters an unknown username  
Label1 - Shows if new user is created  
Title - Shows title of app  
Username - Textbox to enter a username  
Login - A button to click when username is entered to login to app  
Transactions - A list view to show transactions log  
Newuser - A button to click for creating a new user  
NewUsername - a textbox to fill with new username  
AddUser - a button to click when newUsername is filled  
Logout - a button to return to login page  
Close - a button to close the app  
Back_Button - a button to return to the previous page  

The transactions log will show single and joint accounts together in a single list.
